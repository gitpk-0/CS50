make is actually just a program that calls clang, a compiler named for the "C language"

We can compile our source code, hello.c, directly by running the command clang hello.c in the terminal:

clang hello.c

The default file name for clang's output is a.out

We can add an argument to clang to give the program the name we want:

clang -o hello hello.c

clang -o [name_we_want] [c program name]

If libraries are being added to the program they must be included in the command line argument:

clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50

The make command does all of this under the hood

In C, strings end with a special character, '\0', or a byte with all eight bits set to 0, so our programs have a way of knowing where the string ends

This character is called the null character, or NUL

So, we actually need four bytes to store our string with three characters

A non-zero exit status indicates some error to the system that runs our program

Once we run return 1; our program will exit early with an exit status of 1

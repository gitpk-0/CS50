Week 6 -- Python

print(f"hello, {answer}")

The f before the double quotes indicates that this is a format string which will allow us to use curly braces, {}, to include variables that should be substituted, or interpolated

Unlike in C, where curly braces are used to indicate blocks of code, the exact indentation of each line determines the level of nesting in Python. And we don’t need parentheses around the Boolean expressions

Both True and False are capitalized in Python

Lists in Python, [0, 1, 2], are like arrays or linked lists in C

In Python, there are built-in data types similar to those in C:
bool, True or False
float, real numbers
int, integers which can grow as needed
str, strings

Other types in Python include:
range, sequence of numbers
list, sequence of mutable values, or values we can change
tuple, sequence of immutable values
dict, dictionaries, collection of key/value pairs, like a hash table
set, collection of unique values, or values without duplicates

To run a program we wrote in Python, we’ll only need to run:
python hello.py

python is the name of a program called an interpreter, which reads in our source code and translates it to code that our CPU can understand, line by line

Our source code files will also end in .py, to indicate that they’re written in the Python language

Python's input function returns input values as strings by default

So we need to cast, or convert, each value from input into an int before we store it
